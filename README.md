# Fluence ETHDenver 2024 Buidlathon Tracks And Bounties

Welcome to the Year of the SporkWhale which undoubtedly will culminate in another epic Hackathon pushing the boundaries of decentralization to new heights. To this end, Fluence is sponsoring 
five buidl tracks paying out a combined total of USDC 25,000!

## About Fluence

[Fluence](https://fluence.network/) is a decentralized serverless compute and DePin protocol. Buidling on Fluence, developers create Fluence Functions from Wasm and deploy their Fluence Functions to Tier 4 data centers providing provable, decentralized hardware resources. Fluence's on-chain marketplace built on [IPC](https://www.ipc.space/) facilitates the trustless matching of developers' capacity demand and providers' capacity supply one, or many, Fluence Functions at a time. That is, developers not only can work with decentralized compute but be assured that that compute is deployed on DePin instead of centrally controlled data centers. 

Eat the Cloud with Fluence, join us in the Buidlathon and the [Fluence DE:PIN Summit](), 02/27/2024 in mile-high Denver.

**WIP. Stay tuned, subscribe to the repo for updates coming soon.**
